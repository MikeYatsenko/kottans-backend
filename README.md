Speaking about Point 2 (http://linuxcommand.org), itâ€™s quite difficult to read everything, but for me it was very convenient to use the format of tables with expressions, directories and wildcards and their explanations during reading.
## Task 3. Git Collaboration - done

<strong> And what about my feelings...</strong> 
Working with GitHub and Git was new experience for me. Since I worked on my projects almost by myself. Incredibly convenient thing, and most importantly, I felt the optimization of even small details of this tool . The course is interesting , I like the moment that you need to work with the repository by yourself.
Some things were shocking, <i> for example </i>: ![Image alt](https://github.com/MikeYatsenko/kottans-backend/blob/master/Git_Collaboration/4.png)
But in any case, it is <b>very</b> interesting.
So I will continue, thanks!
